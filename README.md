# Arduino-Micro-HID-Keyboard
Building a keyboard from absolute scratch, from writing my own program and making the keyboard frame, to making my own keys. 


Testing the Arduino program was simple, I just wired up two key pads and connected the rows together to make it essentially one 'large' 8x4 matrix. I changed the program to account for this matrix size (leaving out most keys for the sake of testing key modifiers, how many keys I can press at once, etc..)
